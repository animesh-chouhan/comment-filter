Inside the place was filled with Shabad Kirtan.
It was mesmeric inside with each wall shining with pics of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and his preachings. Had the time of my life when a door was opened and I could see the innermost part of the worship area. 

Got the ""Kadha-Prashad"" . 

Nothing more could have I asked for. I stepped out and went around the temple and had ""Amrit"" and felt blessed. Seemed like my inner soul had been wiped out of all negativity and happiness was in every part of my body. 
Very lucky to have been able to visit Hazur Sahib.",

256318,893706,0,160632,"[[@403938]] no, unfortunately. They do not allow solo travelers to enter. However there are always ways to overcome that. You can club with another group of people at the time of immigration. Or get it done by a travel operator who'll charge you around 500 for it, you know for a hassle free entry. And it's not about hotels being costly, it's where you choose to stay. Do not book hotels online, they're super costly that way. Go and book your stay then and there. Not so costly then. :D Hope it helps!",

Sorry for not giving the details

It was a long plan of ours to visit munnar.
For those planning a trip to munnar . I would say not to waste your time out there and will suggest another point called mankulam.

Mankulam is a rural remote village which is still unexplored by many travellusters .
As its over shadowed by munnar and unattended by the tourism department.
For an unforgettable memory , you should have a very talented guide like I would suggest our guide mr.kunjumon +91 94951 62192.
Who is well experienced in driving through the untamed rough terrains out here..
I used the word terrains as road are still a distant dream here.
 
Its one of the best spots in kerala.
Which still has the natural beauty of the mother earth.
Please do visit ?",

64740,0,538162,160632,"[[@99403]] You take a bus to Manali and get down at Bhuntar from where you can either take a taxi/cab or a local bus to Kasol (if you want to stay there for a while) or to Barsaini (if you directly want to go for the trek.) Kasol is in way to Barsaini. The taxis are rather expensive in comparison to the local buses. We, ourselves did stay in Kasol for a couple days and travelled by the local buses. And it cost us about 7k per person. So plan according to how you want to spend. :)",
